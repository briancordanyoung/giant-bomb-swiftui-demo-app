# Giant Bomb Demo App

This is a macOS SwiftUI test app built around the [Giant Bomb API](https://www.giantbomb.com/forums/api-developers-3017/quick-start-guide-to-using-the-api-1427959/). The app allows for a basic search of the avalible games and will show the name and thumbnail when selected.

To run this app you must add a [API key](https://www.giantbomb.com/api/) to the Info.plist under the key: `giant-bomb-api-key`.

Note: You'll most likely need to use the social media technique for logging in (2022-05-16: confirmed this works with google.) Once you're logged in, go back to the [API page](https://www.giantbomb.com/api/) to access your key.


Note: requires Xcode 13 and macOS 12.
